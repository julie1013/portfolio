                <p>I am proud to announce my very first Ember project,
                Simpsons and Chill! This app allows the user to add
                their favorite <em>Simpsons</em> episodes to and remove them
                from a personal playlist. Learning Ember was really
                challenging, yet rewarding-- I realize that there
                is a lot more to learn about it and I look forward
                to doing it.</p>
                <p>A work in progress, the sky's the limit for Simpsons and Chill!</p>

                <p>What five things would you bring with you on a desert island?</p>
                <p>I worked on the front-end of this project with another developer.
                  My personal contributions included code in JavaScript/jQuery,
                  and I also worked in the Handlebars and Bootstrap frameworks</p>
                <p>I also drew the illustration for the landing page.</p>

                <p>What if you would rather read "bad" books than "good" books?</p>
                <p>My first full-stack app and my first foray into Rails, this
                  work-in-progress allows users to add books to and
                  remove them from a to-read list. Eventually, it will allow
                  users to find reasons to remove books from their elephantine
                  to-read lists via scathing reviews from other people.</p>

                <p>Tic-CAT-Toe is one of my first front-end apps. A cute
                  variation on Tic-Tac-Toe, I wrote this app with
                  JavaScript/jQuery, and even drew the cat myself.</p>
                  <p>Eventually, I plan to add a few surprises for when the user
                  wins the game!</p>

              <h1>About Me</h1>
              <p>I have always had a passion for creating, as well as a desire to
                learn about new ways to create. For my entire life,
                my main passions have been drawing and writing.
                Most recently, I have added web development to this list of passions.
                My recently-acquired coding skills through classes at
                General Assembly Boston -- which includes their
                Web Development Immersive -- have helped create the perfect
                marriage with my drawing, photography, and film skills.</p>
            <p>Let me help you make a unique app with a creative twist!</p>
